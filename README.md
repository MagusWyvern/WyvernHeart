## Game Storyline

Mercurial is an adventurer, a fierce hunter that was set out to slay every dragonkind still living in her world

Slyrak is one of the Eldest Eldwyrms she was set out to hunt. As Slyrak was an elder, he honored the hunter's wish, since he also wished to die in combat and not of old age

As the battle ends, pure draak-kin blood merged with Mercurial's, and she would soon discover she is no longer just an ordinary human anymore
